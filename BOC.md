## Breaker of Chains

There are other kingdoms in the Universe who yearn to the ruler of Southeros. However, the High Priest of Southeros is trying to avoid a war and suggests a ballot system to decide the ruler. 

Rules of the Ballot system: 
1. Any kingdom can try to be the ruler
2. They should send a message to all other kingdoms asking for allegiance 
3. This message will be put in a ballot from which the High Priest will pick 6 random messages
4. The High Priest then hands over the 6 messages to the respective receiving kingdoms.
5. The kingdom that receives the highest no of allegiances is the ruler

Rules to decide allegiance
1. The receiving kingdom has to give allegiance to the sender kingdom if the message contains the letters of the animal in their emblem (same as problem 1).
2. The receiving kingdom should not be in the race to be the ruler
3. They should not have already given allegiance 

In case there of tie
1. If there is a tie, the whole ballot process is repeated only with the tied kingdoms till there is a winner 

Sending messages
1. As input you should take the kingdoms wanting to be ruler and send random messages from
